# Zepto-Delivery-Database-Management-System
Zepto is a grocery delivery app that operates on a convenience-focused business model. The key aspects of Zepto's business model include:
1.	Fast Delivery: Zepto promises delivery of grocery orders within 10-15 minutes, catering to consumer demand for instant gratification and convenience.
2.	Curated Product Selection: Zepto maintains a limited but highly curated selection of grocery and household items, focusing on high-demand and fast-moving SKUs rather than attempting to be a one-stop-shop.
3.	Dark Stores: Zepto operates out of strategically located "dark stores" - warehouses optimized for rapid order fulfillment rather than customer foot traffic. This allows for streamlined operations and faster delivery times.
4.	Commission-based Revenue Model: Zepto generates revenue primarily through commissions charged to brand partners whose products are sold on the platform. It may also earn revenue from delivery fees and premium subscription services.
5.	Technology-driven Efficiencies: Zepto leverages technology for inventory management, route optimization, and other operational aspects to drive down costs and enable its rapid delivery model.
6.	Rapid Expansion: Zepto has been focused on rapid geographic expansion, quickly launching in new metro areas to capture market share in the highly competitive instant grocery delivery space.
